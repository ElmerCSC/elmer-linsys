NOTE! As increasing mesh level currently breaks with the P-strategy
one can create larger meshes with netgen using the mesh.geo file.

In netgen a larger mesh can be created by choosing _Refine Uniform_ under
_Refinement_. Mesh can be saved in Elmer compatible form by choosing
_Elmer_ as filetype under _Export Filetype_ in _File_.
