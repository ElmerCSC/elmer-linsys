A bandpass filter is a natural application of Vectorial Helmholtz in solving time-harmonic Maxwell equations. Thus, a simple example of it also makes for a very enlightening example for benchmarking. A very coarse mesh of the problem is visualized above. This is technically the same problem as described in "VectorHelmholtz-BandpassFilterTets", but with a structured mesh. Usually a structured mesh leads to better results than their unstructured counterparts, but in this case the convergence was far worse for most methods. Thus, it is hard to say definitely 

As a vectorial Helmholz the formed coefficient matrix is not positive definite (and most likely not positive semi-definite). Likewise, as a vectorial Helmholtz problem the same analysis also applies here as in the case "VectorHelmholtz-Waveguide". Thus, as the results are very similar, the reader is referred there or can make their own conclusions based on the included plots. For those interested, an example of the sparsity structure for a characteristic matrix is visualized below.
