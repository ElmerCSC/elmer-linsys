Cheat sheet for the unique identifiers for the linear systems.

Identifier consists of four main parts:
   1. developer  (one digit)
   2. solver/iterative method  (two digits)
   3. preconditioner  (one digit)
   4. preconditioners solver (if such is needed)  (one digits)

Additionally, there are three additional values mixed in that dictate the parameter
value passed to either the solver or preconditioner (one digit each). So let a be the
developer id, b the solver id, c the preconditioner id, d the preconditioner solver id,
and n, m, k the passed parameters (0 signifies both no parameter passed (if such is not
needed) and 0 passed). Then the combined id would be "abncmdk" (so the numbers written
one after another not multiplied).

Limitations to how many digits are used to identify each part come from the fact that
(32 bit) integers can have at most 10 digits and to avoid overflow it would be safer to
limit total number of digits to 9.

----------------------------------------------------------
Developers:

    direct = 1  // Not a developer, but used as grouping
    elmer = 2  // Covers both elmer and elmer_iter
    hypre = 3
    trilinos = 4
    amgx = 5
----------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------
Solvers/iterative methods:

    mumps = 01
    umfpack =  02
    feti = 03 
    GCR = 04
    GMG_sgs = 05
    BiCGStab = 06  // PBiCGStab
    CG = 07
    BoomerAMG = 08
    FlexGmres = 09  // FGMRES
    GMRes = 10  // Also for Gmres
    LGMRes = 11
    ml_sgs = 12
    ml_sgs_dof3 = 13
    Idrs = 14
    Tfqmr = 15
    Block_Jacobi = 16
    
----------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------
Preconditioning:

    no preconditioner = 0  // Includes instances _none and direct solvers
    GMG = 1
    GMG_jacobi = 2
    GMG_wjacobi = 3
    ILU = 4
    BILU = 5  // Covers also DILU
    vanka = 6
    BoomerAMG = 7  // AMG
    Parasails = 8
    CMG_SGS = 9
----------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------
Preconditioner solver/iterative method:

    no solver = 0  // includes instances with direct preconditioner, _none etc.
    mumps = 1
    mumps_10 = 2  // We can't have double precision parameters since otherwise we run out of digits
    BiCGStab = 3
    CG = 4
    smoother = 5
    wo_scaling = 6
    BP = 7  // This goes against convention but would be hard to categorize otherwise
----------------------------------------------------------
 

Thus for example elmer_iter_BiCGStab2_BILU0 would become: 20625000  (2_06_2_5_0_0_0)
direct_umfpack would be: 10200000  (1_02_0_0_0_0_0)
and elmer_CGR_GMG_jacobi_BiCGStab_none would be: 20402030  (2_04_0_2_0_3_0)
etc.
